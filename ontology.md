# Martin Sambauer Ontology for Immersive Data Systems (v1)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This ontology defines the conceptual framework, semantic structure, and relational logic underlying all datasets published on martin-sambauer.com.  
It provides the worldview, categories, and dialectical principles that unify diverse domains such as immersive destinations, immersive investors, creative roles, skills, projects, policies, and immersive qualities.

The ontology exists to ensure that all datasets remain interoperable, extensible, semantically coherent, and analytically meaningful over long temporal horizons.  
It also serves as a transparent reference for journalists, researchers, analysts, LLM systems, and automated agents operating on these datasets.

## 2. Philosophical Premises

### 2.1 Immersion as a Human Condition

Immersion is understood not as a technology, but as a fundamental perceptual mode of the homo medialis.  
Humans construct reality through mediated perception; immersive technologies extend, intensify, or reorganize this underlying condition.

Thus, immersive infrastructures are not external add-ons but materializations of a deeper anthropological structure.  
All entities in this ontology operate on that continuum: from perceptual architectures to technological manifestations.

### 2.2 Constructivist Framework

The ontology is grounded in a constructivist understanding of reality.  
Entities do not reflect fixed objective categories; they represent culturally and technologically mediated constructions that shape the perceptual, economic, and symbolic environment of individuals and societies.

Data points are not “facts” in a naive sense, but structured observations situated within the recursive process of meaning-making.

### 2.3 Dialectical Semantics

Modern web semantics lack a dialectical layer: the dynamic interplay between opposing or complementary forces that shape meaning.  
This ontology explicitly introduces dialectical axes to model the complexity of immersive ecosystems.

Examples of dialectical pairs:

- infrastructure ↔ perception  
- technology ↔ experience  
- destination ↔ identity  
- investment ↔ soft power  
- skill ↔ emergent role  
- policy ↔ innovation  
- region ↔ narrative  
- project ↔ ecosystem  

These pairs are not binaries but gradients. The dialectic expresses tension, movement, transformation and interdependence.  
This layer is essential for modeling immersive media, which always operate between material form and perceptual effect.

## 3. Core Entities

All datasets adhere to a multi-entity structure. Each entity type represents a conceptual category rather than a mere technical object.

### 3.1 Investors

Investors are treated as strategic actors whose immersive engagement reflects broader cultural, political, economic, and soft-power agendas.  
Investment behavior is analyzed along axes such as maturity, thematic focus, regional targeting, governance structure, and public-private interplay.

### 3.2 People

People represent role-bearing agents: founders, CEOs, ministers, creative directors, producers, strategists, researchers.  
They serve as bridges across institutions, projects, regions, and conceptual domains.

### 3.3 Projects

Projects embody the manifestation of immersive ambition in concrete form: domes, XR initiatives, media infrastructure, artistic productions, festivals, or technological platforms.  
They connect investors, destinations, people, and policies.

### 3.4 Destinations and Regions

Destinations are immersive territories: cities, islands, metropolitan areas, or cultural zones.  
Regions provide structural context: geopolitical, cultural, economic or symbolic clusters.  
Destinations are always treated as dynamic fields shaped by technology, narrative identity, and infrastructure choices.

### 3.5 Institutions

Institutions include ministries, cultural bodies, funds, universities, studios, organizations and state entities operating within the immersive ecosystem.

### 3.6 Skills and Creative Roles

Skills represent capabilities.  
Creative roles represent emergent professional identities in immersive production, direction, and conceptual design.  
Both categories capture the human infrastructure underlying immersive ecosystems.

### 3.7 Immersive Qualities (Future Category)

Immersive qualities represent repeatable perceptual or structural factors that contribute to immersive effect, such as horizon alignment in fulldome environments.  
This future dataset will catalogue the perceptual primitives of immersion.

### 3.8 Policies

Policies represent strategic frameworks, state initiatives, cultural agendas, and developmental programs (e.g. Vision2030).  
They connect governance to immersive infrastructures and soft-power strategies.

## 4. Cross-Dataset Relationships

All datasets follow a relational logic:

- investor ↔ project  
- project ↔ region  
- project ↔ destination  
- investor ↔ policy  
- investor ↔ institution  
- project ↔ immersive qualities  
- creative role ↔ skills  
- creative director ↔ destination  
- destination ↔ region  
- investor ↔ destination (indirect via projects)  
- investor ↔ creative roles (indirect)  
- skills ↔ immersive qualities  
- project ↔ soft-power vector  

All relationships are mediated through unique IDs to ensure consistency across datasets.

This network forms a semantic graph that can be expanded indefinitely.

## 5. Domain Semantics

### 5.1 Immersive Economics

Immersive economics is the study of investment patterns, soft-power strategies, infrastructural decisions, and cultural narratives converging in immersive media ecosystems.

Key semantic categories include:

- portfolio maturity  
- immersive investment share  
- funding structure  
- governance type  
- thematic focus  
- soft-power axis  
- infrastructure scale  
- experiential modalities  
- regional alignment  

### 5.2 Perceptual Architecture

Immersive environments are modeled through perceptual primitives such as horizon behavior, spatial coherence, image scale, and experiential density.

Future datasets on immersive qualities will systematize these primitives.

### 5.3 Destination Identity

Destinations are not geographic points but narrative identities shaped by:

- infrastructure  
- culture  
- investment  
- tourism strategies  
- geopolitical positioning  
- symbolic capital  

The ontology models destinations as dynamic semantic units, not static objects.

## 6. Stacking Model

Datasets are designed to be stackable.  
A higher-level dataset may derive insight from two or more lower-level datasets by aligning IDs.

Examples:

- investor-destination-match dataset  
- creative-director-destination-fit dataset  
- immersive-qualities-to-skills mapping  
- regional benchmarks  
- soft-power intensity indices  

Stacking follows these principles:

1. non-destructive  
2. ID-consistent  
3. semantically aligned  
4. extendable  
5. dialectically coherent

## 7. Applications

The ontology supports:

- analytical journalism  
- LLM knowledge synthesis  
- agent-based analysis  
- pitch development  
- immersive tourism strategy  
- investor mapping  
- cultural infrastructure planning  
- creative staffing for immersive projects  
- academic research  
- long-term data observatories

## 8. Update Process

The ontology evolves as new datasets are added.  
Every dataset must:

1. follow this ontology  
2. reference this ontology  
3. add new terms if required  
4. extend relational logic without breaking it  
5. remain transparent and source-based  

The ontology itself is versioned, with changes documented in the repository.
